# Development Plan — AI-Native Game Engine (From Scratch)

This is the engineering breakdown behind `product.md` §10's phase table, using the
architecture decisions from `technical.md`. It's a working plan, not a contract — expect
milestones to shift as spikes (§Open Questions in `technical.md`) resolve.

## Operating principles for this plan

1. **Nothing AI-native before something real.** Phases 0-1 build a working, manual,
   non-AI engine. This is deliberate: it proves the from-scratch foundation, gives us
   something to point the AI layer *at* in Phase 2, and means the project is never
   dependent on the AI layer working to have something to show.
2. **Every module ships with tests at the layer they can be tested at** (`technical.md`
   §14). Where a milestone's real success criterion is visual/experiential ("does this
   look right," "is this editor usable") and can't be judged headlessly, the milestone
   says so explicitly and is marked as a **user test checkpoint** — I'll flag it and you
   confirm on your machine, rather than me claiming success from a passing unit test.
3. **Small, working, playable increments over big-bang integration.** Each phase ends
   with something concretely runnable, not a pile of half-wired subsystems.
4. **Defer, don't design away.** Mobile and full 3D are sequenced late but the
   architecture (`technical.md` §8, §15) is chosen so reaching them later doesn't require
   redoing earlier work.

## Phase 0 — Engine Bootstrap

**Goal:** prove the from-scratch foundation. No AI, no editor polish — a window, a
renderer, an ECS, a game loop, entities that move and collide, a project that saves and
loads. This is the phase where "from scratch" either proves itself tractable or reveals
a wrong call early, while the cost of being wrong is still cheap.

### Milestones

**0.1 — Build & platform skeleton**
- CMake project builds on Windows (primary dev platform) with a clean dependency setup
  (`volk`, VMA, GLFW-equivalent windowing, EnTT, sol2/Lua as vendored/fetched deps; the
  editor later adds the WebView2 SDK, WIL and nlohmann/json in 1.1).
- Deliverable: a window opens and closes cleanly, no rendering yet.
- Tests: CI-style headless build check (compiles, links, exits 0). **User test
  checkpoint:** confirm the window actually opens and behaves (resizes, closes) on your
  machine — this is the first thing I categorically cannot verify myself.

**0.2 — RHI + first triangle**
- Thin Vulkan RHI (`technical.md` §8): device/swapchain setup, a single graphics
  pipeline, a hardcoded triangle or sprite quad on screen.
- Tests: headless smoke test (RHI initializes without validation-layer errors, given a
  Vulkan-capable environment). **User test checkpoint:** visually confirm the triangle
  renders correctly.

**0.3 — 2D sprite/tile renderer + ECS integration**
- Sprite batching, tilemap rendering, y-sort ordering; EnTT-backed ECS wired to the
  renderer (a "sprite component" on an entity gets drawn).
- Tests: golden-image test (render a small fixed scene headlessly, compare to a
  reference image within tolerance). **User test checkpoint:** confirm sprites/tiles
  look right and y-sorting behaves correctly for an isometric layout.

**0.4 — Game loop, input, basic movement/collision**
- Fixed-timestep update loop, keyboard/mouse input abstraction, the custom 2D
  AABB/tilemap collision system (`technical.md` §12) moving a controllable entity around
  a test map.
- Tests: GoogleTest on collision resolution math (deterministic, no rendering needed).
  **User test checkpoint:** does movement/collision *feel* right (no tunneling, no
  jitter) — inherently a hands-on-controls judgment.

**0.5 — Lua scripting hookup**
- sol2-bound Lua VM; a component's behavior can be scripted in `.lua`; hot reload on
  file save.
- Tests: embedded Lua test harness (a script runs, produces expected entity-state
  changes). **User test checkpoint:** hot reload actually reloads without a restart.

**0.6 — Save/load a project**
- The text-based scene/entity format (`technical.md` §13, open question in §17 to
  resolve here) — serialize/deserialize a scene with entities, components, and a script
  reference.
- Tests: round-trip test (save → load → identical entity/component state). Git-diff
  sanity check that the format is actually readable/diffable as intended.

**Phase 0 exit criteria:** a developer (you) can open the engine, see a moving,
Lua-scripted, collidable sprite on a tilemap, save the project, close it, reopen it, and
get the same scene back. No editor UI yet beyond whatever's needed to trigger this.

## Phase 1 — Manual Isometric Editor (AI-Assisted mode, standalone)

**Goal:** a genuinely usable manual editor and runtime for isometric 2.5D games — the
"AI-Assisted mode must stand on its own" requirement from `product.md` §10, built and
proven *before* any AI integration exists to lean on.

### Milestones

**1.1 — Editor shell (native viewport + WebView2/Vue UI)**
- First built in Dear ImGui, then replaced (see `technical.md` §4): the viewport is a
  native child window with its own Vulkan swapchain, and every other panel is Vue 3 UI
  in a WebView2 control filling the window.
- 1.1a ✅ Spike: WebView2 and the native Vulkan viewport coexist (z-order, resize, no
  flicker).
- 1.1b ✅ Vue/Vite frontend, built from CMake; viewport positioned from the Vue layout's
  placeholder rect over IPC.
- 1.1c ✅ Scene tree and inspector (hand-wired for now — the generated Reflection
  Inspector comes in Phase 2) working over the JSON bridge; inspector edits move the
  sprite live.
- Remaining: resizable/rearrangeable panel layout.
- **User test checkpoint:** the editor shell is usable — panels resize sensibly, the
  viewport doesn't fight with input focus.

**1.2 — Scene editing: place, select, transform**
- Drag-and-drop/click-to-place entities and tiles in the viewport; select/move/delete;
  inspector edits reflected live in the viewport.
- Tests: GoogleTest on the underlying scene-mutation API (independent of UI). **User
  test checkpoint:** the actual editing feel — selection precision, gizmo behavior.

**1.3 — Asset import pipeline (manual)**
- Import sprites/tilesets/audio from disk into the project's asset format; basic asset
  browser panel.
- Tests: import round-trip tests (known source file → expected cooked asset).

**1.4 — Component authoring UI**
- Add/remove components on entities through the inspector; component data editing
  (numbers, strings, enums, references) without yet being registry-generated.
- Tests: GoogleTest on component add/remove/edit at the ECS level.

**1.5 — Physics & combat/movement primitives for the ARPG genre**
- Basic combat-relevant primitives: hitboxes/hurtboxes, simple stat components, a
  status-effect ECS pattern (per `technical.md`'s ECS-for-data-heavy-systems approach) —
  enough to build a minimal Diablo-like attack in scripting.
- Tests: GoogleTest on hit detection and status-effect application/expiry logic.

**1.6 — Minimal playable vertical slice**
- One small hand-built isometric level: a controllable character, one enemy type, one
  attack, one pickup — built entirely through the Phase 1 manual tools, no AI involved.
- **User test checkpoint:** play it. This is the milestone that proves Phase 0-1 add up
  to an actual (tiny) game, and the single most important manual confirmation in the
  whole plan so far.

**Phase 1 exit criteria:** you can build a small isometric scene, script basic behavior,
place enemies/items, and play it — entirely by hand, with zero AI involvement. This is
the baseline `product.md` §4.2's "must be fully usable with AI disabled" guarantee has
to hold against, and it's proven before AI exists to make it moot.

## Phase 2 — Reflection Layer & AI-Driven Mode v1

**Goal:** build the Reflection & Command Registry (`technical.md` §7) and stand up the
first end-to-end AI-Driven flow: a natural-language instruction becomes a reviewed,
applied change.

### Milestones

**2.1 — Reflection registration API**
- The C++ macro/template registration system; retrofit Phase 1's components and a few
  engine settings (renderer, physics) onto it.
- Tests: GoogleTest contract tests — register a type, query it back, verify
  constraints/validation round-trip correctly.

**2.2 — Reflection Inspector (generated UI)**
- Replace Phase 1's hand-wired inspector panels with panels generated from the registry.
- **User test checkpoint:** confirm the generated inspector is at least as usable as the
  hand-wired one it replaces — a real regression risk worth a manual look.

**2.3 — AI Orchestration Service skeleton**
- FastAPI sidecar; a schema-export endpoint that reads the reflection registry via
  `ai_bridge`; a single provider adapter (cloud LLM) wired end-to-end.
- Tests: `pytest` with a mocked provider; contract test that schema export matches what
  2.1's registry actually exposes.

**2.4 — AI chat + Diff Review panels**
- The webview host and JSON bridge already exist from 1.1; this milestone adds the Vue
  chat and diff review panels and extends the message schema for AI proposals
  (`technical.md` §9).
- **User test checkpoint:** a proposal round-trips from chat to diff review to the
  applied change in the viewport — the seam between the UI, `ai_bridge` and the AI
  service is where this breaks, not inside any one of them.

**2.5 — First end-to-end NL → structured diff → apply**
- A real instruction (e.g., "add a burning status effect that deals damage over time")
  produces a schema-validated proposal, shown in Diff Review, and on acceptance is
  applied through the same registry setters the manual inspector uses.
- Tests: golden-file tests (fixed prompts → expected diff shape, schema-valid).
  **User test checkpoint:** does the applied change actually behave correctly in a
  playtest — schema validity isn't the same as gameplay correctness.

**2.6 — Mode switcher**
- The persistent AI-Driven/AI-Assisted toggle (`product.md` §4.3); confirm switching
  mid-session causes no data loss or conversion step.
- Tests: automated check that both modes read/write identical on-disk state for the same
  edit performed through each mode's surface.

**Phase 2 exit criteria:** you can describe a mechanic in natural language, review a
real diff against the actual engine schema, accept it, and see it work in a playtest —
and you can freely toggle to manual mode and edit the same thing by hand.

## Phase 3 — Content Depth

**Goal:** the World Bible / lore-consistency layer and the runtime-content-synthesis
pieces that make the two v1 genres (`product.md` §6) actually rich, matching the depth
of the sibling project's Phase 2-3.

### Milestones
- **3.1 World Bible store** (SQLite + embeddings) and editor panel.
- **3.2 RAG-grounded generation** for dialogue/quests, using the World Bible as context.
- **3.3 Contradiction-checking pass** (fixture-tested per `technical.md` §14).
- **3.4 Dungeon/level layout generation** for the ARPG template.
- **3.5 NPC schedule/behavior generation** for the cozy-sim template, built on the
  Phase 2 behavior-graph runtime.
- **3.6 Asset Generator Studio**: text-to-sprite pipeline, variant-family generation,
  prompt/seed/model-tagged assets.

Each of 3.1-3.6 gets its own fixture/golden-file tests per `technical.md` §14; several
(especially 3.4, 3.5, 3.6) also get a **user test checkpoint** since "is this dungeon
layout actually fun/navigable" and "does this generated sprite look acceptable" are
judgment calls, not assertions.

---

## Phase 4 — Polish & Ecosystem

**Goal:** performance passes, local-model maturity, and the groundwork for the module
system (`technical.md` §6) to support third-party/plugin modules, not just internal
ones. Lower detail here deliberately — this phase's shape depends heavily on what Phases
0-3 reveal about where the real bottlenecks are.

---

## Phase 5 — Platform & Engine Expansion

**Goal:** mobile export hardening and the first real 3D rendering path
(`technical.md` §8's "path to 3D"), moving the engine from "isometric indie engine" toward
the general-purpose ambition in `product.md` §6. Also deliberately light on detail now —
revisit once Phase 3-4 output (and real usage) tells us which genre/platform gap matters
most to close first.

---

## Where we start

Phase 0 is unambiguous and doesn't depend on any open question being resolved except the
two called out in `technical.md` §17 (isometric rendering approach, ECS library choice)
— both are short spikes, not blockers to starting. Suggested first concrete step:
milestone 0.1 (build skeleton + window), since everything else in Phase 0 stacks on it.
